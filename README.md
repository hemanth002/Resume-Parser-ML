# ðŸ“„ Resume Parser using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project is a Resume Parser built using Python and NLP techniques. It is designed to automatically extract structured data from resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX). The goal is to streamline the candidate screening process by helping recruiters and HR systems extract and organize information like names, contact details, education, experience, and skills.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes in different formats and layouts. Manually reviewing these resumes is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project solves that problem by automating the resume parsing process using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The parser extracts key fields and outputs them in a consistent, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
